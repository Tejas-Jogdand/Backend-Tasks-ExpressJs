# üîß Beginner Express Tasks (Learning & Sharing)

This repository contains a collection of backend mini-projects that I'm building to **learn**, **practice**, and **share** my understanding of server-side development using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.

Each project focuses on a specific concept such as routing, middleware, authentication with JWT, MongoDB integration, and building RESTful APIs. I'm documenting everything to reinforce my own learning while also helping anyone who is starting their backend journey.

## üìÅ Project Structure

Each folder is a self-contained backend project with:

- `index.js` or `server.js` (entry point)
- `routes/` folder for API routes
- `models/` for Mongoose schemas (if used)
- `middleware/` for auth & other custom logic
- Individual `README.md` for project-specific setup

---

## üõ† Tech Stack

- **Node.js** (JavaScript runtime)
- **Express.js** (web framework)
- **MongoDB** with **Mongoose** (for some projects)
- **JWT** (JSON Web Token for auth)
- **Postman / cURL** for API testing

## üß† What I'm Practicing

- Setting up Express servers from scratch
- Building RESTful APIs
- Using JWT for secure authentication
- Connecting MongoDB via Mongoose
- Structuring clean and modular backend apps
